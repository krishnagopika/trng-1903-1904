**Continious Integration:** Integration of new code to an existng code repository.

**Continious Delivery:** CI triggers a build process. The code chnages are automatically built, tested and prepared for a production release.

**Continious Deployment:** The artifact is automatically deployed to production environment.


### Jenkins

- Jenkins is an open source, self contained, automation server for CI/CD>
